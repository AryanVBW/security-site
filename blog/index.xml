      <description>At this time, we do not believe that ASF projects or ASF infrastructure are directly impacted by CVE-2024-3094. We have no indication that the person(s) responsible for the backdoor have contributed to any ASF projects. After our initial, risk-based triage, our security team is now working with each project&amp;rsquo;s oversight team (the PMC) to review their possible use of the xz library through dependency for a second level of scrutiny and review.</description>

      <title>Credits for finding security vulnerabilities</title>

      <description>We highly appreciate everyone who responsibly reports security issues to us: a diverse mix of community members, independent security researchers, software auditing firms, etc.
When we release a fix for a vulnerability in one of our projects, we publish a security advisory crediting the reporter, and distribute it though various Apache mailinglists, oss-security and the CVE programme: this way, we proactively signal the urgency to upgrade to our users.
The Apache Software Foundation, being a volunteer organization, does not have a bug bounty program.</description>

      <description>Background The security committee of The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) oversees and coordinates the initial triage, handling, and process around vulnerabilities across all of the 320+ Apache projects handling over 65 incoming emails a day. Established in 2002, we have a consistent process for how issues are handled, and this process includes how our projects must disclose security issues. We have a single paid person to help deal with incoming vulnerability handling work, with the rest of the team, including the VP, being volunteers.</description>

      <title>Apache vulnerability severity rating system</title>
      <link>https://security.apache.org/blog/severityrating/</link>

      <description>When disclosing a security vulnerability in a previous version of an Apache software project, the project typically assigns a severity level such as &amp;ldquo;low&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;critical&amp;rdquo;. For most projects we&amp;rsquo;ve have never defined what those levels mean.Â In this blogpost we introduce a default severity rating system, based on the scales we&amp;rsquo;ve been using with some specific projects for a long time.
From the early days of the Apache HTTP Server project we assigned an impact rating to security flaws, designed to be &amp;ldquo;How worried should I be about this vulnerability&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>CVE-2022-42889: interpolations that allow RCE disabled in Commons Text 1.10.0</title>
      <link>https://security.apache.org/blog/cve-2022-42889/</link>

      <description>On 2022-10-13, the Apache Commons Text team disclosed CVE-2022-42889. Key takeaways:
If you rely on software that uses a version of commons-text prior to 1.10.0, you are likely still not vulnerable: you are only affected when this software uses the StringSubstitutor API without properly sanitizing any untrusted input. If your own software uses commons-text, double-check whether it uses the StringSubstitutor API without properly sanitizing any untrusted input. If so, an update to 1.</description>
