Contributions to this site are warmly encouraged.

The Security Team may either directly commit to `main` (CTR-style)
or first create a PR. Outside contributions should be presented
as a PR or a patch to `security-discuss@community.apache.org`, to
be reviewed and merged by the security team.

To avoid disappointment, if you're planning a larger contribution
it might be good to first discuss the change in a GitHub issue or
on `security-discuss@community.apache.org`.
