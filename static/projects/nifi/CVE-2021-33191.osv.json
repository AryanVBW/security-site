{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-33191", "summary": "MiNiFi CPP arbitrary script execution is possible on the agent's host machine through the c2 protocol", "details": "From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements an \"agent-update\" command which was designed to patch the application binary. \nThis \"patching\" command defaults to calling a trusted binary, but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a \"c2-update\"\ncommand. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as the application binary.  This was addressed in version 0.10.0", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0.5.0"}, {"fixed": "Apache NiFi - MiNiFi C++*"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/24/1"}]}
