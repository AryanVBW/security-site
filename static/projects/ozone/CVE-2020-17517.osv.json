The current security vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or users.  This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Ozone"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Ozone"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdd59a176b32c63f7fc0865428bf9bbc69297fa17f6130c80c25869aa%40%3Cdev.ozone.apache.org%3E"}]}
