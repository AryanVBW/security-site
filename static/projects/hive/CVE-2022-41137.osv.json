From an API perspective any code that calls the unsafe method may be vulnerable unless it performs additional prerechecks on the input arguments.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "4.0.0-alpha-1"}, {"fixed": "4.0.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hive"}, {"type": "REPORT", "url": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-26539"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/hive/commit/60027bb9c91a93affcfebd9068f064bc1f2a74c9"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/jwtr3d9yovf2wo0qlxvkhoxnwxxyzgts"}]}
