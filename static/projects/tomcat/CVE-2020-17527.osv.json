{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2020-17527", "summary": "Apache Tomcat: Request header mix-up between HTTP/2 streams", "details": "While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak between requests.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 10 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 10 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 8.5 8.5.0 to 8.5.59"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 8.5 8.5.0 to 8.5.59"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rce5ac9a40173651d540babce59f6f3825f12c6d4e886ba00823b11e5%40%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E"}]}
