Implementing proper certificate validation by passing context=ssl.create_default_context() during FTP_TLS instantiation is used as mitigation to validate the certificates properly.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Airflow FTP Provider: before 3.7.0.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 3.7.0, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "3.7.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38266"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/blob/95e26118b828c364755f3a8c96870f3591b01c31/airflow/providers/ftp/hooks/ftp.py#L280"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#best-defaults"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/265t5zbmtjs6h9fkw52wtp03nsbplky2"}]}
