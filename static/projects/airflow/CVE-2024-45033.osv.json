This only happened when the password was changed with CLI. The problem does not happen in case change was done with webserver thus this is different from  CVE-2023-40273 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pm87-24wq-r8w9  which was addressed in Apache-Airflow 2.7.0\n\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 1.5.2, which fixes the issue.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "1.5.2"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/45139"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/yw535346rk766ybzpqtvrl36sjj789st"}]}
