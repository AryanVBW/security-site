{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-41766", "summary": "Insecure Java Deserialization in Apache Karaf", "details": "Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime by\nusing the Java Management Extensions (JMX).\nJMX is a Java RMI based technology that relies on Java serialized\nobjects for client server communication.\nWhereas the default JMX implementation is hardened against\nunauthenticated deserialization attacks, the implementation\nused by Apache Karaf is not protected against this kind of attack.\n\nThe impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities strongly depends\non the classes that are available within the targets\nclass path. \nGenerally speaking, deserialization of untrusted data does always \nrepresent a high security risk and should be prevented.\n\nThe risk is low as, by default, Karaf uses a limited set of classes in the JMX server class path.\nIt depends of system scoped classes (e.g. jar in the lib folder).", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Karaf"}, {"fixed": "4.3.6"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2021-41766.txt"}]}
