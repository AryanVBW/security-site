{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2022-42920", "summary": "Apache Commons BCEL prior to 6.6.0 allows producing arbitrary bytecode via out-of-bounds writing", "details": "Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache Commons BCEL 6.6.0.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Commons BCEL"}, {"fixed": "6.6.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/lfxk7q8qmnh5bt9jm6nmjlv5hsxjhrz4"}]}
