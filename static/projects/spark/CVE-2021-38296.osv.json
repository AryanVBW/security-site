{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-38296", "summary": "Apache Spark Key Negotiation Vulnerability", "details": "Apache Spark supports end-to-end encryption of RPC connections via \"spark.authenticate\" and \"spark.network.crypto.enabled\". In versions 3.1.2 and earlier, it uses a bespoke mutual authentication protocol that allows for full encryption key recovery. After an initial interactive attack, this would allow someone to decrypt plaintext traffic offline. Note that this does not affect security mechanisms controlled by \"spark.authenticate.enableSaslEncryption\", \"spark.io.encryption.enabled\", \"spark.ssl\", \"spark.ui.strictTransportSecurity\".  Update to Apache Spark 3.1.3 or later", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "up to and including version 3.1.2"}, {"last_affected": "up to and including version 3.1.2"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/70x8fw2gx3g9ty7yk0f2f1dlpqml2smd"}]}
