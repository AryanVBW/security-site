{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2023-22946", "summary": "Apache Spark proxy-user privilege escalation from malicious configuration class", "details": "In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-submit can specify a 'proxy-user' to run as, limiting privileges. The application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.\n\nUpdate to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that \nspark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its \ndefault of \"false\", and is not overridden by submitted applications.\n\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "3.4.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/yllfl25xh5tbotjmg93zrq4bzwhqc0gv"}]}
