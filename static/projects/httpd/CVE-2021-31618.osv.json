{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-31618", "summary": "NULL pointer dereference on specially crafted HTTP/2 request", "details": "Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks received request headers against the size limitations as configured for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a status code indicating why the request was rejected.\n\nThis rejection response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to DoS the server.\n\nThis issue affected  mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never released.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.4.47"}, {"last_affected": "2.4.47"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "http://httpd.apache.org/security/vulnerabilities_24.html"}, {"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2021/q2/206"}]}
