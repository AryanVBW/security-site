Potentially this could be combined with vulnerabilities in other components to achieve remote code execution.\n\nAs this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or restrict access to the instance to trusted users.\n\nNOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0.5.0"}, {"last_affected": "0.5.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/564kbv3wqdzkscmdn2bg4vlk48qymryp"}]}
