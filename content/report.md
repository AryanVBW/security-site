| If you found a potential issue with ASF infrastructure such as the apache.org websites, email infrastructure or version control systems. | If you found an advisory for a library in the dependency tree of an ASF project or artifact | If you found a potential issue in the codebase of an ASF project |

If you do not want to report an issue in any of the three categories above, but instead have a question such as:

* how to configure the package securely
* whether a published vulnerability applies to specific versions of the Apache packages you are using
* whether a published vulnerability applies to the configuration of the Apache packages you are using
* obtaining further information on a published vulnerability
* the availability of patches and/or new releases to address a published vulnerability

... then we recommend contacting the project on their regular, open communication
channels, such as their 'users' mailinglist.
