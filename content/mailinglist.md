To privately disclose a security vulnerability in one
of our projects, use [this process](https://www.apache.org/security/).

If you'd like to discuss ASF-wide security-related topics, you might
be interested in joining the public `security-discuss` mailinglist: read the [archives](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?security-discuss@community.apache.org) and subscribe by sending an email to [security-discuss-subscribe@community.apache.org](mailto:security-discuss-subscribe@community.apache.org). Once subscribed, you can send your mail to [security-discuss@community.apache.org](security-discuss@community.apache.org)
