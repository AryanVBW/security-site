## regex injection leading to DoS ## { #CVE-2021-33580 }

CVE-2021-33580 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-33580.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2021-08-18T07:43:44.770Z_

### Affected

* Apache Roller from Apache Roller before 6.0.2


### Description

User controlled `request.getHeader("Referer")`, `request.getRequestURL()` and `request.getQueryString()` are used to build and run a regex expression.

The attacker doesn't have to use a browser and may send a specially crafted Referer header programmatically. Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side.  This problem has been fixed in Roller 6.0.2.

CVE-2023-37581 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-37581.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2023-08-24T08:15:22.581Z_

### Affected

* Apache Roller before 6.1.2


### Description

<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Insufficient input validation and sanitation in Weblog Category name, Website About and File Upload features in all versions of Apache Roller on all platforms allows an authenticated user to perform an XSS attack. </span><span style="background-color: var(--wht);">Mitigation: if you do not have Roller configured for untrusted users, then you need to do nothing because you trust your users to author raw HTML and other web content. If you are running with untrusted users then you should upgrade to Roller 6.1.2 and you should disable Roller's File Upload feature.â€ƒ</span><br><br><p></p>
