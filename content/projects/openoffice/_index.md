## DEB packaging for Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 installed with a non-root userid and groupid ## { #CVE-2021-28129 }

CVE-2021-28129 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-28129.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache OpenOffice at 4.1.8


### Description

While working on Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 a developer discovered that the DEB package did not install using root, but instead used a userid and groupid of 500. This both caused issues with desktop integration and could allow a crafted attack on files owned by that user or group if they exist.

Users who installed the Apache OpenOffice 4.1.8 DEB packaging should upgrade to the latest version of Apache OpenOffice.

## Code execution in Apache OpenOffice via non-http(s) schemes in Hyperlinks ## { #CVE-2021-30245 }

CVE-2021-30245 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-30245.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache OpenOffice from Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.9


### Description

The project received a report that all versions of Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.8 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks. The problem has existed since about 2006 and the issue is also in 4.1.9. If the link is specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution. It is always best practice to be careful opening documents from unknown and unverified sources. The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10 (unreleased) assures that a security warning is displayed giving the user the option of continuing to open the hyperlink.

## Buffer overflow from a crafted DBF file ## { #CVE-2021-33035 }

CVE-2021-33035 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-33035.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache OpenOffice from Apache OpenOffice through 4.1.10
* Apache OpenOffice from OpenOffice.org through 3.4


### Description

Apache OpenOffice opens dBase/DBF documents and shows the contents as spreadsheets.  DBF are database files with data organized in fields.  When reading DBF data the size of certain fields is not checked: the data is just copied into local variables. A carefully crafted document could overflow the allocated space, leading to the execution of arbitrary code by altering the contents of the program stack.  

This issue affects Apache OpenOffice up to and including version 4.1.10

This issue is fixed in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.11

## Apache OpenOffice Static Initialization Vector Allows to Recover Passwords for Web Connections Without Knowing the Master Password ## { #CVE-2022-37400 }

CVE-2022-37400 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-37400.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache OpenOffice from Apache OpenOffice 4 before 4.1.13


### Description

Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where the required initialization vector for encryption was always the same which weakens the security of the encryption making them vulnerable if an attacker has access to the user's configuration data. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13.

## Apache OpenOffice Weak Master Keys ## { #CVE-2022-37401 }

CVE-2022-37401 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-37401.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache OpenOffice from Apache OpenOffice 4 before 4.1.13


### Description

Apache OpenOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in the user's configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in OpenOffice existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulnerable to a brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored config. This issue affects: Apache OpenOffice versions prior to 4.1.13.  Reference: CVE-2022-26307 - LibreOffice
