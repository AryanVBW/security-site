## Timing attack in Cookie signature verification ## { #CVE-2020-1926 }

CVE-2020-1926 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2020-1926.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2020-1926.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2021-03-16T12:44:51.635Z_

### Affected

* Apache Hive from Apache Hive before 2.3.8


### Description

Apache Hive cookie signature verification used a non constant time comparison which is known to be vulnerable to timing attacks. This could allow recovery of another users cookie signature. The issue was addressed in Apache Hive 2.3.8

## Apache Hive Security vulnerability in Hive with UDFs ## { #CVE-2021-34538 }

CVE-2021-34538 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-34538.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-34538.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-07-16T07:05:22.225Z_

### Affected

* Apache Hive from Apache Hive before 3.1.3


### Description

Apache Hive before 3.1.3 "CREATE" and "DROP" function operations does not check for necessary authorization of involved entities in the query. It was found that an unauthorized user can manipulate an existing UDF without having the privileges to do so. This allowed unauthorized or underprivileged users to drop and recreate UDFs pointing them to new jars that could be potentially malicious.

## Deserialization of untrusted data when fetching partitions from the Metastore ## { #CVE-2022-41137 }

CVE-2022-41137 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-41137.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-41137.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-12-05T10:01:39.567Z_

### Affected

* Apache Hive from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0


### Description

Apache Hive&nbsp;Metastore (HMS) uses&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">SerializationUtilities#deserializeObjectWithTypeInformation</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;method when filtering and fetching partitions that is unsafe and</span>&nbsp;can lead&nbsp;to Remote Code Execution (RCE) since it allows the deserialization of arbitrary data.<br><br>In real deployments, the vulnerability can be exploited only by authenticated users/clients that were able to successfully establish&nbsp;a connection to the Metastore. From an API perspective any code that calls the unsafe method may be vulnerable unless it performs additional prerechecks on the input arguments.

## Arbitrary command execution via JDBC driver ## { #CVE-2023-35701 }

CVE-2023-35701 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-35701.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2023-35701.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-05-03T08:11:05.595Z_

### Affected

* Apache Hive from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0


### Description

Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection') vulnerability in Apache Hive.<br><br>The vulnerability affects the Hive JDBC driver component and it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machine/endpoint that the JDBC driver (client) is running. The malicious user must have sufficient permissions to specify/edit JDBC URL(s) in an endpoint relying on the Hive JDBC driver and the JDBC client process must run under a privileged user to fully exploit the vulnerability.&nbsp;<br><br>The attacker can setup a malicious HTTP server and specify a JDBC URL pointing towards this server. When a JDBC connection is attempted, the malicious HTTP server can provide a special response with customized payload that can trigger the execution of certain commands in the JDBC client.<p>This issue affects Apache Hive: from 4.0.0-alpha-1 before 4.0.0.</p><p>Users are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.0, which fixes the issue.</p>

## CookieSigner exposes the correct signature when message verification fails ## { #CVE-2024-23945 }

CVE-2024-23945 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-23945.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-23945.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-12-23T15:26:52.096Z_

### Affected

* Apache Hive from 1.2.0 before 4.0.0
* Apache Spark from 2.0.0 before 3.0.0
* Apache Spark from 3.0.0 before 3.3.4
* Apache Spark from 3.4.0 before 3.4.2
* Apache Spark at 3.5.0


### Description

Signing cookies is an application security feature that adds a digital signature to cookie data to verify its authenticity and integrity. The signature helps prevent malicious actors from modifying the cookie value, which can lead to security vulnerabilities and exploitation. Apache Hiveâ€™s service component accidentally exposes the signed cookie to the end user when there is a mismatch in signature between the current and expected cookie. Exposing the correct cookie signature can lead to further exploitation.<br><br>The vulnerable CookieSigner logic was introduced in Apache Hive by&nbsp;HIVE-9710 (1.2.0) and in Apache Spark by SPARK-14987 (2.0.0). The affected components are the following:<br>* org.apache.hive:hive-service<br>* org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.11<br>* org.apache.spark:spark-hive-thriftserver_2.12<br><br>
