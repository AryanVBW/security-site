## Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Storm-core on Unix-Like systems due temporary files ## { #CVE-2023-43123 }

CVE-2023-43123 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-43123.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Storm from 2.0.0 before 2.6.0


### Description

<div>On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems.<br><br>The method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and by default will create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local users can read this information.<br></div><div><br></div><div>File.createTempFile(String, String) will create a temporary file in the system temporary directory if the 'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set. <br><br>This affects the class&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99">https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99</a>&nbsp;and was introduced by&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123</a><br></div><div><br>In practice, this has a very limited impact as this class is used only if&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(206, 204, 247);">ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring</span></div> <div><span style="background-color: var(--wht);">is set to false, but its value is true by default.<br>Moreover, the temporary file gets deleted soon after its creation.<br><br>The solution is to use&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: var(--hig);"><a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.nio.file.attribute.FileAttribute...)">Files.createTempFile</a></span><span style="background-color: var(--wht);">&nbsp;instead.<br><br>We recommend that all users upgrade to the latest version of Apache Storm.</span></div><div><span style="background-color: var(--wht);"><br></span></div><br>
