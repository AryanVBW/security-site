## CWE-284 Improper Access Control on Configurations Endpoint for the Stable API ## { #CVE-2021-26559 }

CVE-2021-26559 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26559.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Airflow at 2.0.0


### Description

Improper Access Control on Configurations Endpoint for the Stable API of Apache Airflow allows users with Viewer or User role to get Airflow Configurations including sensitive information even when `[webserver] expose_config` is set to `False` in `airflow.cfg`. 

This allowed a privilege escalation attack.

This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.

## Apache Airflow: Lineage API endpoint for Experimental API missed authentication check ## { #CVE-2021-26697 }

CVE-2021-26697 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-26697.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Airflow at 2.0.0


### Description

The lineage endpoint of the deprecated Experimental API was not protected by authentication in Airflow 2.0.0. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint.

This is low-severity issue as the attacker needs to be aware of certain parameters to pass to that endpoint and even after can just get some metadata about a DAG and a Task.

This issue affects Apache Airflow 2.0.0.

## Session fixation in Apache Airflow web interface ## { #CVE-2023-40273 }

CVE-2023-40273 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-40273.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Airflow before 2.7.0


### Description

<p>The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for <code>database</code>&nbsp;session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and all other users with that).</p><p>With this fix implemented, when using the&nbsp;<code>database</code>&nbsp;session backend, the existing sessions of the user are invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the <code>securecookie</code>&nbsp;session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver (and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI. Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour.</p>Users of Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.<br>

### Description

<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">In the Apache Airflow HDFS Provider, versions prior to 4.1.1, a documentation&nbsp;info pointed users to an install incorrect pip package. As this package name was unclaimed, in theory, an attacker could claim this package and provide code that would be executed when this package was installed. The Airflow team has since taken ownership of the package (neutralizing the risk), and fixed the doc strings in version 4.1.1</span><br>

## DAG Params alllow to embed unchecked Javascript ## { #CVE-2023-47265 }

CVE-2023-47265 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-47265.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Airflow from 2.6.0 before 2.8.0


### Description

Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS vulnerability that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-sanitized javascript in the parameter description field of the DAG.&nbsp;This Javascript can be executed on the client side of any of the user who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this issue does not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users.<br><br>Users of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability<br>

## Kubernetes configuration file saved without encryption in the Metadata and logged as plain text in the Triggerer service ## { #CVE-2023-51702 }

CVE-2023-51702 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-51702.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider from 5.2.0 before 7.0.0
* Apache Airflow from 2.3.0 before 2.6.1


### Description

Since version 5.2.0, when using deferrable mode with the path of a Kubernetes configuration file for authentication, the Airflow worker serializes this configuration file as a dictionary and sends it to the triggerer by storing it in metadata without any encryption. Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0, the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use it to access the Kubernetes cluster.<br><br>This behavior was changed in version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 7.0.0, which fixes this issue.
