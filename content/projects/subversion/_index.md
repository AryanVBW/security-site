## Remote unauthenticated denial-of-service in Subversion mod_authz_svn ## { #CVE-2020-17525 }

CVE-2020-17525 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2020-17525.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2021-03-17T09:12:33.507Z_

### Affected

* Apache Subversion at mod_authz_svn 1.10.7
* Apache Subversion from mod_authz_svn before 1.14.1


### Description

Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL. This can lead to disruption for users of the service.  This issue was fixed in mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.14.1 and mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.10.7

## Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression ## { #CVE-2021-28544 }

CVE-2021-28544 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-28544.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2021-28544.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-04-12T17:46:18.140Z_

### Affected

* Apache Subversion at 1.10.0 to 1.14.1


### Description

Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression  Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules.  When a node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original.  This also reveals the fact that the node was copied.  Only the 'copyfrom' path is revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are vulnerable.

## Apache Subversion mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption ## { #CVE-2022-24070 }

CVE-2022-24070 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2022-24070.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2022-24070.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2022-04-12T17:46:14.441Z_

### Affected

* Apache Subversion at 1.10.0 to 1.14.1


### Description

Subversion's mod_dav_svn is vulnerable to memory corruption.  While looking up path-based authorization rules, mod_dav_svn servers may attempt to use memory which has already been freed.  Affected Subversion mod_dav_svn servers 1.10.0 through 1.14.1 (inclusive). Servers that do not use mod_dav_svn are not affected.

## Command line argument injection on Windows platforms ## { #CVE-2024-45720 }

CVE-2024-45720 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-45720.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-45720.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-10-09T12:38:27.375Z_

### Affected

* Apache Subversion from 1.0.0 through 1.14.3


### Description

On Windows platforms, a "best fit" character encoding conversion of command line arguments to Subversion's executables (e.g., svn.exe, etc.) may lead to unexpected command line argument interpretation, including argument injection and execution of other programs, if a specially crafted command line argument string is processed.<br><br>All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.3 are affected on Windows platforms only. Users are recommended to upgrade to version Subversion 1.14.4, which fixes this issue.<br><br><div>Subversion is not affected on UNIX-like platforms.</div><br>

## mod_dav_svn denial-of-service via control characters in paths ## { #CVE-2024-46901 }

CVE-2024-46901 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2024-46901.cve.json) [\[OSV json\]](./CVE-2024-46901.osv.json)



_Last updated: 2024-12-09T09:36:41.289Z_

### Affected

* Apache Subversion through 1.14.4


### Description

Insufficient validation of filenames against control characters in Apache Subversion repositories served via mod_dav_svn allows authenticated users with commit access to commit a corrupted revision, leading to disruption for users of the repository.<br><br>All versions of Subversion up to and including Subversion 1.14.4 are affected if serving repositories via mod_dav_svn. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.14.5, which fixes this issue.<br><br>Repositories served via other access methods are not affected.
