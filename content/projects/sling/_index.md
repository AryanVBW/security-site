## SMTPS server hostname not checked when making TLS connection to SMTPS server ## { #CVE-2021-44549 }

CVE-2021-44549 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-44549.cve.json)

_Last updated: 2021-12-14T15:10:31.167Z_

### Affected

* Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail at Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 1.0.0 1.0.0


### Description

Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail provides a simple layer on top of JavaMail/Jakarta Mail for OSGi to send mails via SMTPS.

To reduce the risk of "man in the middle" attacks additional server identity checks must be performed when accessing mail servers.

For compatibility reasons these additional checks are disabled by default in JavaMail/Jakarta Mail.

The SimpleMailService in Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 1.0 lacks an option to enable these checks for the shared mail session.
A user could enable these checks nevertheless by accessing the session via the message created by SimpleMessageBuilder and setting the property mail.smtps.ssl.checkserveridentity to true.

Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 2.0 adds support for enabling server identity checks and these checks are enabled by default.

_Last updated: 2023-02-23T08:41:12.080Z_

### Affected

* Apache Sling from Apache Sling i18n through 2.5.18


### Description

Privilege Escalation vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation Apache Sling.<br>Any content author is able to create i18n dictionaries in the repository in a location the author has write access to. As these translations are used across the whole product, it allows an author to change any text or dialog in the product. For example an attacker might fool someone by changing the text on a delete button to "Info".<br><p>This issue affects the i18n module of Apache Sling up to version 2.5.18. Version 2.6.2 and higher limit by default i18m dictionaries to certain paths in the repository (/libs and /apps).</p><p>Users of the module are advised to update to version 2.6.2 or higher, check the configuration for resource loading and then adjust the access permissions for the configured path accordingly.<br></p>
