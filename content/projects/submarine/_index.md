### Affected

* Apache Submarine from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0


### Description

Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471">https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471</a>.<br><br>Apache Submarine uses JAXRS to define REST endpoints.  In order to
handle YAML requests (using application/yaml content-type), it defines
a YamlEntityProvider entity provider that will process all incoming
YAML requests.  In order to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method
is invoked, passing the entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-server/server-core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.<br> <br>We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to `jackson-dataformat-yaml`.<br>This issue affects Apache Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0, which fixes this issue.<br><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">If using the version smaller than 0.8.0  and not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054">https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054</a> and rebuild the submart-server image to fix this.</span><br><br></span><br>
