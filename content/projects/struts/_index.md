## Forced OGNL evaluation, when evaluated on raw not validated user input in tag attributes, may lead to RCE. ## { #CVE-2021-31805 }

CVE-2021-31805 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2021-31805.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache Struts at 2.0.0 to 2.5.29


### Description

The fix issued for CVE-2020-17530 was incomplete. So from Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.29, still some of the tagâ€™s attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.
