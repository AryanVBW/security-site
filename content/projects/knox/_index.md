_Last updated: 2022-01-17T19:19:12.317Z_

### Affected

* Apache Knox from Apache Knox 1.x before 1.6.1
* Apache Knox from 0.12.0 before Apache Knox 0.x*


### Description

When using Apache Knox SSO prior to 1.6.1, a request could be crafted to redirect a user to a malicious page due to improper URL parsing.
A request that included a specially crafted request parameter could be used to redirect the user to a page controlled by an attacker. This URL would need to be presented to the user outside the normal request flow through a XSS or phishing campaign.
