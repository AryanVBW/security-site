## Apache DolphinScheduler 3.0.0 to 3.1.1 python gateway hasÂ improper authentication ## { #CVE-2023-25601 }

CVE-2023-25601 [\[CVE json\]](./CVE-2023-25601.cve.json)

### Affected

* Apache DolphinScheduler from 3.0.0 before 3.1.2


### Description

On version 3.0.0 through 3.1.1, Apache DolphinScheduler's python gateway suffered from improper authentication: an attacker could use a socket bytes attack without authentication. This issue has been fixed from version 3.1.2 onwards. For users who use version 3.0.0 to 3.1.1, you can turn off the python-gateway function by changing the value `python-gateway.enabled=false` in configuration file `application.yaml`. If you are using the python gateway, please upgrade to version 3.1.2 or above.<br>
