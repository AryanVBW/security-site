title: "xz/liblzma/libarchive compromise"
date: 2024-03-30
description: At this time we have no reason to believe Apache projects are directly impacted by this compromise, also known as CVE-2024-3094.
---

At this time, we do not believe that ASF projects or ASF infrastructure are directly impacted by CVE-2024-3094.
We have no indication that the person responsible for the backdoor has contributed to any ASF projects.
After our initial, risk based, triage, our security team is now working with the core developers (PMC) of each of the projects that may make use of the xz library through dependency for a second level of scrutiny and review.

Situation per PMC (up to date til 2024-03-31 12:00 UTC)

| Project | Status | dylib[1] |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Apache Activemq | Clear | No |
| Apache Arrow | Clear | Yes |
| Apache Celix | Clear | Yes |
| Apache Commons Compress | Clear[2] | No |
| Apache CouchDB | Clear | No[3] |
| Apache Guacamole | Clear | Yes |
| Apache IoTDB| Clear[2] | No |
| Apache Kudu | Clear | No |
| Apache Lucene | Clear | No |
| Apache OpenOffice | Clear | Yes[1-bis] |
| Apache Solar | Clear | No |
| Apache Serf | Clear | No |
| Apache Thrift | Clear | |
| Apache Subversion | Clear | Yes |
| Apache Trafficserver | Clear |Yes[4] |
| Apache Uima | Clear | No |

**Note 1:** In certain settings, executables may rely on a local/system-level dynamically loaded library containing code from XZ (either directly or, for example via language bindings). Endusers should follow instructions/updates of OS and package managers.

**Note 1-bis:** However binaries shipped by the ASF will not rely in OS/system level XZ.

**Note 2:** This java project relies on org.tukaani/xz version 1.9 (21 March 2021) or earlier; i.e prior to known actions of the bad actor(s) associated with CVE-2024-3039

**Note 3:** The web interface has a Node.js **build-time** but relies on Node.js 18; an  LTS release that likely predates this issue.  The Node project has announced on March 27th a security release for April 3rd[1] that might be related. 

**Note 4:** Optional runtime on liblzma, project does not ship as binary; so depends on how it is compiled locally & installed local version of liblzma.
