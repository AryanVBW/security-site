title: "xz/liblzma/libarchive compromise"
date: 2024-03-30
description: At this time we have no reason to believe Apache projects are directly impacted by this compromise, also known as CVE-2024-3094.
---

At this time, we do not believe that ASF projects or ASF infrastructure are directly impacted by CVE-2024-3094.
We have no indication that the person(s) responsible for the backdoor have contributed to any ASF projects.
After our initial, risk-based triage, our security team is now working with each project's oversight team (the PMC)
to review their possible use of the xz library through dependency for a second level of scrutiny and review.

## Project specific information

**Note 1:** In certain deployments, executables may rely on a local/system-level dynamically-loaded library containing code from XZ (either directly or, for example via language bindings). End users should follow instructions/updates of OS and package managers.

**Note 1-bis:** Binaries shipped by the ASF will not rely in OS/system level XZ; but builds by third parties may.

**Note 2:** This java project relies on org.tukaani/xz version 1.9 (21 March 2021) or earlier; these releases are prior to known actions of the bad actor(s) associated with CVE-2024-3039

**Note 3:** The web interface has a Node.js **build-time** but relies on Node.js 18 **run-time**, which is a release that likely predates this issue.  The Node project [announced on March 27th a security release for April 3rd that might be related]([https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/april-2024-security-releases). 

**Note 4:** Optional runtime dependency on (local) liblzma; the project does not ship a binary for the library; any impact may depend on how it is compiled locally and if a compromised version of liblzma is present.
