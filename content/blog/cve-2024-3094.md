description: At this time we have no reason to believe Apache projects are directly impacted by this compromise, also known as CVE-2024-3094.

At this time, we do not believe that ASF projects or ASF infrastructure are directly impacted by CVE-2024-3094.
We have no indication that the person responsible for the backdoor has contributed to any ASF projects.
After our initial, risk based, triage, our security team is now working with the core developers (PMC) of each of the projects that may make use of the xz library through dependency for a second level of scrutiny and review.
