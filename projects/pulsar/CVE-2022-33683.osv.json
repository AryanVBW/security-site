{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2022-33683", "summary": "Disabled Certificate Validation makes Broker, Proxy Admin Clients vulnerable to MITM attack ", "details": "Apache Pulsar Brokers and Proxies create an internal Pulsar Admin Client that does not verify peer TLS certificates, even when tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration. The Pulsar Admin Client's intra-cluster and geo-replication HTTPS connections are vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could leak authentication data, configuration data, and any other data sent by these clients.\n\nAn attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker and Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.10.0"}, {"last_affected": "2.10.0"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.7"}, {"last_affected": "2.7"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.8"}, {"last_affected": "2.8"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.9"}, {"last_affected": "2.9"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.6 and earlier"}, {"last_affected": "2.6 and earlier"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/42v5rsxj36r3nhfxhmhb2x12r5jmvx3x"}]}
