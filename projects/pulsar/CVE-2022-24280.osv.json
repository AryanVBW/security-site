An attacker could use this as a way for DoS attacks that originate from the Pulsar Proxy's IP address.\nIt hasnâ€™t been detected that the Pulsar Proxy authentication can be bypassed. The attacker will have to have a valid token to a properly secured Pulsar Proxy.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Pulsar Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.2; 2.9.0 to 2.9.1; 2.6.4 and earlier.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.7"}, {"last_affected": "2.7"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.8"}, {"last_affected": "2.8"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.9"}, {"last_affected": "2.9"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.6 and earlier"}, {"last_affected": "2.6 and earlier"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/ghs9jtjfbpy4c6xcftyvkl6swznlom1v"}]}
