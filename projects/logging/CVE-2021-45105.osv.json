{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-45105", "summary": "Apache Log4j2 does not always protect from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation", "details": "Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3 and 2.3.1) did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "log4j-core"}, {"fixed": "2.17.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html"}, {"type": "REPORT", "url": "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LOG4J2-3230"}]}
