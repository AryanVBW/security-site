Apache Johnzon 1.2.21 mitigates this by setting a scale limit of 1000 (by default) to the BigDecimal. \n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Johnzon: through 1.2.20.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"last_affected": "0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/qbg14djo95gfpk7o560lr8wcrzfyw43l"}]}
