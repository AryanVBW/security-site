{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2024-39887", "summary": "Improper SQL authorisation, parse not checking for specific engine functions", "details": "An SQL Injection vulnerability in Apache Superset exists due to improper neutralization of special elements used in SQL commands. Specifically, certain engine-specific functions are not checked, which allows attackers to bypass Apache Superset's SQL authorization. To mitigate this, a new configuration key named DISALLOWED_SQL_FUNCTIONS has been introduced. This key disallows the use of the following PostgreSQL functions: version, query_to_xml, inet_server_addr, and inet_client_addr. Additional functions can be added to this list for increased protection.\n\nThis issue affects Apache Superset: before 4.0.2.\n\nUsers are recommended to upgrade to version 4.0.2, which fixes the issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "0"}, {"fixed": "4.0.2"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/j55vm41jg3l0x6w49zrmvbf3k0ts5fqz"}]}
