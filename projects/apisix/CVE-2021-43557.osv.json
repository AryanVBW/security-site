{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-43557", "summary": "Path traversal in request_uri variable", "details": "The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request URI without normalization.\nThis makes it possible to construct a URI to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the block list contains \"^/internal/\", a URI like `//internal/` can be used to bypass it.\n\nSome other plugins also have the same issue. And it may affect the developer's custom plugin.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "1.5"}, {"fixed": "Apache APISIX 1.5*"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/18jyd458ptocr31rnkjs71w4h366mv7h"}]}
