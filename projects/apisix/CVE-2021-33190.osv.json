{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-33190", "summary": "Bypass network access control", "details": "In Apache APISIX Dashboard version 2.6, we changed the default value of listen host to 0.0.0.0 in order to facilitate users to configure external network access. In the IP allowed list restriction, a risky function was used for the IP acquisition, which made it possible to bypass the network limit. At the same time, the default account and password are fixed.Ultimately these factors lead to the issue of security risks.  This issue is fixed in APISIX Dashboard 2.6.1\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache APISIX Dashboard 2.6 2.6"}, {"last_affected": "Apache APISIX Dashboard 2.6 2.6"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re736aea55e8fd2478f0739c0c38a9375c4204fc1f0bd1ea687f57049%40%3Cdev.apisix.apache.org%3E"}]}
