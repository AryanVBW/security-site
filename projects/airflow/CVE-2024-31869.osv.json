{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2024-31869", "summary": "Sensitive configuration for providers displayed when \"non-sensitive-only\" config used", "details": "Airflow versions 2.7.0 through 2.8.4 have a vulnerability that allows an authenticated user to see sensitive provider configuration via the \"configuration\" UI pageÂ when \"non-sensitive-only\" was set as \"webserver.expose_config\" configuration (The celery provider is the only community provider currently that has sensitive configurations). You should migrate to Airflow 2.9 or change your \"expose_config\" configuration to False as a workaround. This is similar, but different to  CVE-2023-46288 https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9qqg-mh7c-chfq  which concerned API, not UI configuration page.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "2.7.0"}, {"last_affected": "2.7.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://github.com/apache/airflow/pull/38795"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/pz6vg7wcjk901rmsgt86h76g6kfcgtk3"}]}
