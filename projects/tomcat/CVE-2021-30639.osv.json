{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-30639", "summary": "DoS after non-blocking IO error", "details": "A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely trigger a denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change to improve error handling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error flag associated with the Request object was not reset between requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred, all future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a connection, thereby creating the possibility of triggering a DoS.\nApplications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this vulnerability.
