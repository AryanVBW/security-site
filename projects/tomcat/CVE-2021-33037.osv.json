{"schema_version": "1.6.1", "id": "CVE-2021-33037", "summary": "Incorrect Transfer-Encoding handling with HTTP/1.0", "details": "Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.66 did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically:\n- Tomcat incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if the client declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response;\n- Tomcat honoured the identify encoding; and\n- Tomcat did not ensure that, if present, the chunked encoding was the final encoding.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 10 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 10 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 9 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46"}]}, {"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Tomcat 8 8.5.0 to 8.5.66"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Tomcat 8 8.5.0 to 8.5.66"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r612a79269b0d5e5780c62dfd34286a8037232fec0bc6f1a7e60c9381%40%3Cannounce.tomcat.apache.org%3E"}]}
