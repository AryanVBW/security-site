This could lead to authentication bypass and other operational problems should an attacker decide to spoof their IP address this way. Users are recommended to upgrade to CloudStack version 4.18.1.1 or 4.19.0.1, which fixes this issue.\n\n", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "4.11.0.0"}, {"last_affected": "4.11.0.0"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "WEB", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/82f46pv7mvh95ybto5hn8wlo6g8jhjvp"}, {"type": "WEB", "url": "https://cloudstack.apache.org/blog/security-release-advisory-4.19.0.1-4.18.1.1"}]}
