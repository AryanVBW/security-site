Use of 1.15 on Java 11 will automatically protect JMX over RMI against deserialization attacks. This should have no impact on performance since it only affects JMX/RMI which Gfsh uses to communicate with the JMX Manager which is hosted on a Locator.", "affected": [{"ranges": [{"type": "SEMVER", "events": [{"introduced": "Apache Geode"}, {"last_affected": "Apache Geode"}]}]}], "references": [{"type": "ADVISORY", "url": "https://lists.apache.org/thread/kr1y4l9752g1ww1shnmh8dbfjq785k4m"}]}
